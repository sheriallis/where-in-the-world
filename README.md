# Where in The World

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## [View Completed Project](https://srd-whereintheworld.netlify.com/)

Get information about countries using the REST Countries API. Built using React, Axios, and styled-components. Includes color theme switcher.

The design was made by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Their challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

You can: 
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode



### Tools/Resources Used

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Run app locally 

Clone the repository by typing the following code in your terminal.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sheriallis/where-in-the-world.git
```

Change into the directory

```sh
cd where-in-the-world
```

Install all dependencies

### `yarn install` or `npm install`

Once these dependencies have been installed you can run the app in development mode using:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

This will start a local server on port 3000. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

If you want to build for production, run:

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

The app is ready to be deployed.
